      <p>
        My name is Ryan Walker and I am a full-stack developer from Youngstown,
        Ohio. Learning how to code started out as a hobby for me, but I grew
        obsessed with building things that required both creativity and logic.
        Right now I am currently enrolled at Lambda School where I spend 40+
        hours a week learning the latest web development trends and fundamental
        computer science skills to bring my projects to life.
